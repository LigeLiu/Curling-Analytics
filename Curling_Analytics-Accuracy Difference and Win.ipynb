    "### Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Scoreboard management in curling refers to managing the score and the hammer of the future ends. The team that has the hammer (last stone of the end) has the advantage to score. Once a team scores, the team that did not score in the preceding end has the hammer. If neither team scores, called a blanked end, the hammer remains with the same team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the tactical value of the hammer, the team with the hammer aims to score more than multiple points or to blank the end to keep the hammer. Teams also tends to keep the hammer in even ends so that the team will have the hammer in the last end. Often, teams need to decide how much to score with the hammer in the last few ends to maximize the chance to win.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, Iâ€™m trying to explore how much games are won under different ends, score difference, and with or without hammer. For example, I want to how many/what percentage of games are won when at the beginning of End 8, the team with hammer is leading with 1 point?"
