# Curling Analytics

In this project, I used data analytics approaches in attempt to analyze the sport of curling. The data comes from the Shot-by-shot reports published by World Curling Federation (WCF). The inspiration and data processing method come from Jordan Myslik’s [curling-analytics project](https://github.com/jwmyslik/curling-analytics).

## Introduction

As a curling fan and business analytics student, I always want to apply what I learned in class to the real world. After intensely watching the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, I noticed the rising of curling analytics and decided to give it a try myself. This project demonstrates some of the effort in applying data analytics to curling.

Curling is a sport with a series of discrete events (each stone thrown). Such nature gives potentials for the sport to be analyzed and modeled using analytics and statistical methods. What I have done here is mostly descriptive analytics, but I can see the potential to develop predictive and prescriptive analytics. This is the future objective for this project.

## Topics Discussed in the Project

The following is the list of the topics, or business questions, discussed in the project. This list will get continuously updated as the project progresses.

+ Curling scoreboard management analysis: Win rate in relation to ends played, score difference, and hammer or first stone

## Contents in the Repository

+ Report that summarize the findings (continuously updated)

+ Database used for analyses (generated using Jordan Myslik’s [curling-analytics project]( https://github.com/jwmyslik/curling-analytics))

+ Jupyter notebooks that contains codes for analysis of each topic
